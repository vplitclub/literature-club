         <p style="font-size:14px">Entry 2: No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Entry 28: It’s been just short of a month since I began my entries in this diary. Since then, our
team has attempted to kill Uncle Felix countless times. Our fruitless endeavours have not
spoiled our spirits, however. Torturing the creature has helped us learn about the limits of his
kind. We at the organization strive for success, regardless of the sacrifice.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> Lisa suggested bringing in a volunteer shooter to kill Uncle Felix. That woman claimed that
having an inexperienced intern enter Felix’s enclosure, unmasked and unguarded (save for a
weapon), our experiment may yield different results. Until now, nobody has dared to step foot
inside the space reserved for Felix. Killing at close range won’t change anything. Even if I were
to oppose her idea, she would see her plans through to the end.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">The chosen volunteer was a young intern working under Lisa. Strapped to her back was a
weapon of her choice, a battered old hunting rifle. The youth of this generation have such
peculiar tastes. I doubt Uncle Felix would have approved of such an old weapon if he could
comprehend any of our conversations. The girl fired the shots in succession. Uncle Felix
sustained five bullets to the head, one to the front left claw and another to the abdomen. It's
always uncomfortable to see organs spilling from his open wounds. Current death count:
1863.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 33: Uncle Felix has made a rapid recovery since last week. He seems to have regained
the ability to speak. Though he only spews intelligible nonsense, I do believe his state of mind
is slowly reverting to how it was in the past. His apathetic disposition is changing; traces of
fear appear on his face when he sees someone stand near the door of his enclosure.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 36: Lisa’s attitude towards me has changed ever since she found out that I was the one
to bring Uncle Felix to the lab. She rambled on about how loyal I am to the organization. I don’t
understand that woman at all. Lisa ignored me for weeks on end, but only shows interest once
she realizes how valuable my work is? Shameless woman. I’m sure she’s plotting something.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">My suspicions were correct, as expected. Today I found Lisa in Uncle Felix’s
enclosure. A loaded gun gripped in her left hand, a box of matches in her right. A long gash
stretching from the tip of her chin to her ribcage. Her corpse has already begun undergoing
rigor mortis. Uncle Felix was still asleep when I found Lisa’s body. What sort of fool would enter an unkillable manticore’s chamber with no sort of backup? Even after death, her
intentions are still unclear.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 38: The volunteer shooter has been following me around as of late. She seems to have
some odd fascination with Uncle Felix. It seems that Lisa let it slip that Felix was brought in by
me. That woman continues to be a nuisance, dead or alive. The volunteer shooter formally
introduced herself to me as “N”. She wishes to be under my jurisdiction following Lisa’s
untimely death. I’ve decided to let her work as my assistant. I don’t have high expectations for
her, but I hope she can learn a thing or two from me.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 45: It’s been a week since N started working as my assistant. Her interest in Uncle Felix
has multiplied since discovering the story behind his origin. I fail to understand how she thinks
an artificially-made manticore is better from one found in the wild.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">We’ve given up on killing Uncle Felix. Nobody has figured out what Lisa had planned to do by
entering the enclosure that day, and nobody wants to get too deeply involved with another’s
affairs. Uncle Felix has been showing even more signs of improvement. He’s regained the
ability to understand me. I think him observing my conversations with N has helped.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 60: I will be entering the enclosure myself today. I plan to read Uncle Felix a bedtime
story, just as he used to do for me. N has been avoiding me as of late. I saw her rummaging
around my desk. She must think I was involved with Lisa’s death.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Entry 87: The team has been dispirited since the sudden disappearance of N. I’ve released a
new project in hopes of raising their spirits. A two-headed hydra is much more fun to play with
than a manticore. To begin with, Uncle Felix was never meant to die. Lisa’s efforts were for
naught — no amount of bullets or matches could kill a hybrid made by me. We at the
organization strive for success, regardless of the sacrifice.
