         <p style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. Last
week was Uncle Felix’s 18th funeral. 18th! Nicholas was sick and tired of all the black clothes
piling up in his closet and the one-week mourning period in which everyone would approach him
with wary, mournful eyes as they apologized for his loss. Except, much to Nicholas’ dismay,
Uncle Felix would be back again exactly one week after the week of mourning, as if he never
died. Nicholas would come downstairs in the morning only to see Uncle Felix seated at the
kitchen table, newspaper in hand. Uncle Felix was ironically reading the exact newspaper that
continuously published his obituary time after time, funeral after funeral. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Nicholas had no clue why or how it was even possible for Uncle Felix to be brought back
to life, especially because Uncle Felix would die in the strangest circumstances. Once he
choked while trying to swallow a marshmallow, in another instance, his parachute malfunctioned
while skydiving. When Nicholas tried to ask Uncle Felix what happened to him - where he went
after he died and how he came back to life, Uncle Felix would enter into a trance and manic-like
state, frantically mumbling incoherent words to himself under his breath. Nicholas tried his best
to make out what Uncle Felix said, but after some incomprehensible mumbling about what he
thought sounded like chicken noodle soup, Nicholas gave up altogether.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> It wasn’t that Nicholas didn’t like his Uncle Felix, he loved him of course, but it always
unsettled him that Uncle Felix would reappear after his funerals and act as if nothing was out of
the ordinary. In fact, it wasn’t just Uncle Felix who couldn’t remember a single thing about his
funeral or his many strange deaths. Everyone including Nicholas’s family members and Uncle
Felix’s friends couldn’t remember any of Uncle Felix’s previous funerals or deaths. Nicholas
started to doubt his sanity as every time he asked his father (or anyone else for that matter)
about Uncle Felix’s many passings, his father would ask him if this was another one of those
fantastical stories he’s always reading and suggest that Nicholas take his head out of his books
and back into reality. It wasn’t until Nicholas started checking the obituary of The Daily Times
that he realized the newspaper was reprinting Uncle Felix’s obituary with different funeral dates
that spanned over the last 13 months.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Nicholas knew that the key behind Uncle Felix’s deaths lay within the newspaper. He
resolved to head to The Daily Times headquarters the very next day to find out who was
submitting Uncle Felix’s obituary.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">———</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">When Nicholas arrived at The Daily Times, he took the elevator to the 4th floor - the
obituary section. Just as he stepped out of the elevator, he noticed a familiar form speaking with
a journalist. Nicholas couldn’t believe it! It was Uncle Felix! Nicholas quickly hid behind an office
cubicle as he watched a sorrowful Uncle Felix describe his own death to a journalist.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">“I just can’t believe Felix was taken by a bee sting! He was never allergic before!
Growing up on a honey farm, we were both stung hundreds of times!” explained Uncle Felix,
“Thank you for your time Ron, our family greatly appreciates your publications, I’m sure if Felix
were still alive, he’d be ever grateful.”
Nicholas quickly intercepted Uncle Felix as he headed toward the elevators. “UNCLE
FELIX! YOU’RE ALIVE AND YOU REMEMBER YOUR DEATHS! YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S
BEEN SENDING IN YOUR OWN OBITUARY!” Nicholas exclaimed.
Uncle Felix let out a sigh as he continued, “Yes, it was me. I’ve been sending in my
obituaries.”</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">“So you remember your deaths and funerals?” Nicholas asked as Felix quickly nodded.
“Why did you pretend you didn’t understand me when I previously asked you about your
deaths?”
“I’m sorry I lied to you, Nicky, I didn’t want to cause you any more pain. I honestly have
no clue how I’m still here, I know I was supposed to go the night of the first car accident, but I
think I’m stuck here because I just don’t want anyone to forget about me.”
“I could never forget you, Uncle Felix. Even when you’re gone, your wisdom and our
memories together will be with me for the rest of my life,” said Nicholas, his voice full of emotion,
“you’ve been such a big part of my life and I’ll continue to carry your legacy forever.”
“Thank you, Nicholas. I feel a new sense of peace with your reassuring words.” Uncle
Felix replied with a sad smile as he started slowly disappearing, “I must go now, may we meet
again - hopefully not at my next funeral.”
“May we meet again.”</p>
