         <p style="font-size:14px">Oct 30th, 2040, was a gloomy night in the St. Johnâ€™s neighbourhood. Everyone was inside, 
           going crazy about this new app coming out. A few months ago, every social media app got banned and was going to get upgraded to a better version. 
           The first app coming out was on October 31st. It was the new and improved TikTok. Everyone was excited about the new app, "what will it be like? 
           Will it have the same function? 
           What are the filters going to be like?" No one knows what the app has, or if it will be better than TikTok before. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">t's now October 31th, Halloween. A few teens, Marco, Ayden, Azzy and Chris, are hanging out, checking the timer for the new game to come, in the forest as a "party" for Halloween. 
           "I'm so excited about the new app today!" said Azzy, while continuing to look at her phone. 
"It'll be cool. It's about to come out in a minute," said Marco with no enthusiasm in his voice as he puts his B-phone down.
A few minutes after texting people about the new arrival, the app finally came. 4 teenagers downloaded the app with shaky hands while going through the filters. One caught Ayden's eye. 
"Hey look! There's a trick-or-treat filter!" Ayden said while putting the filter on. 
"Let's play it" replied Chris with his eyes glued to his phone.
For hours and hours, they did tricks and fun things in their time while recording the fun, taking turns to do things, however, Marco didn't go yet. 
"Yo Marco, take a turn." Said Chris while recording Azzy's stupid trick. 
"Yeah, it'll be fun!" Azzy replied while going back to her tree.
"No, it's fine..." replied Marco while getting ready to go back.
"You're so boring," replied Ayden, "You never wanna do anything fun."</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> Marco didn't reply. He just started walking back, while his friends' boos got quiet. 
After a few minutes, the words of his friend stung harder. Maybe I should have done it. I'm so boring. They are my only friends. With these voices in his head, he ran back to just take one turn. Nothing can go wrong, right?
"Guys! I'll do it! I'll try once. Only once." Marco yelled while catching his breath. 
"Finally you're not boring," Azzy replied, "Ayden get the app out."
Ayden excitedly got his phone out going on the app. He brought it to his friend's face, and the filter started picking what to ask. So many things were going through Marco's mind. Will it be safe? Please don't be bad. I can't get grounded. What if I end up in jail? All this worry soon ended when he saw his answer. Trick: Do a dare someone gives you. 
Not bad Marco thought to himself. They can't do anything that bad, right? They are my friends after all. 
"Hmmm, a dare..." Azzy said while still glued to her phone. 
Marco soon started to panic, "I mean, we can do tomorrow, it's getting late and-" "No no," replied Ayden calmly, "We'll give you a dare." 
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">After a while of thinking, and searching dares of Egor, the new Google. Chris thought of a good one.
"Yo! go to that old dead Granny's house on Peterborough Street," Chris said with excitement in his voice, "Best dare, am I right?"
Azzy and Ayden agreed and started walking to the old house. Marco followed them while trying to find excuses to not go, but none worked. Soon after he was in front of the door. 
"Well? Go in." Azzy said with sass in her voice. 
Marco gulped but went inside the house. It was dark but light enough to see through the details. It had webs and old portraits of the old lady and her kids. Marco felt safe, but not for long when he heard a click. The door shut. His friends ran while Marco cried for them to open the door. He screamed but no one heard. Except a lady, in her 70s walking down the old wooden stairs. 
"Who are you? Why are you in my house!" she yelled as she ran to the boy. 
Marco said nothing. He was scared and did not know what to say. 
"I'm sorry. I-It was a dare, and-"  </p>
<p style="font-size:14px">"No worries. Come with me."
The old lady showed Marco around the house while telling stories. After that, she opened the door.
"Thank you ma'am!" said Marco with a full stomach, "It's a great place and I'm sorry about-"
"Don't worry boy, just go, don't want people to forget about you."
Forget? What does she mean? 
Marco didn't think anything of it. Then he checked his phone: Oct 21st, 2050.
