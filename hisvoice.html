		 <i style="font-size:10px"> by Shahd Karout</i>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. I saw him again today, in the same place as always. Outside the window, near the lobby of our apartment building, waving to us right before going home and never waking up. Or at least, that’s what it seemed to be. He’s still here, even though no one believes it.</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">. . .</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">Felix was my dad’s friend. He would come to our house often when I was still a kid. He was practically family to us and would babysit me when my parents weren’t home. “Tara,” I hear him whisper. His voice causes me to shudder. “How come? You used to love pancakes, you said they tasted best when your Uncle Felix made them.” I gulp at the sound of his name. Something just doesn’t feel right. “I don’t know, I just-- I just don’t really like pancakes anymore.” “Suit yourself.” Grabbing the peanut butter and jam containers from the fridge, I spread them on each piece of toast, trying to create a perfect mix. I hear someone by the stove, making something using a frying pan. The dark room is full of strange figures, illuminated by the stars in the night sky and the headlights of passing cars. I know that the strange figure in the corner of my room is just my desk with my flower pot on it, but I feel him. He’s near, very near. I feel sick to my core, wanting his presence to go away, but it never does. I try to go back to sleep, but every time I go to bed I see him, vividly. It’s like I travel back to the past. I take a deep breath, and force my eyes shut. “Tara…” His voice is cold and deep. “Yes?”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“Keep this a secret, okay?”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“Pinky promise?” “Pinky promise.”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">I awake to the sound of my mom’s voice, talking to my dad in the living room as the TV gets it’s channels switched every minute. Ugh, if only the walls were made a bit thicker, maybe then I’d be able to sleep better. After I wash up, I enter the living room. “Good morning, honey,” my mom says. "Good morning.”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“There’s pancakes on the table.”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">My stomach turns. “I’ll just make a sandwich.”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“How come? You used to love pancakes, you said they tasted best when your Uncle Felix made them.” I gulp at the sound of his name. Something just doesn’t feel right. “I don’t know, I just-- I just don’t really like pancakes anymore.” “Suit yourself.” Grabbing the peanut butter and jam containers from the fridge, I spread them on each piece of toast, trying to create a perfect mix. I hear someone by the stove, making something using a frying pan.</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“Guess what I’m making for you?” “I don’t know,” I say.</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">“It’s your favourite,” he smiles. “Pancakes?" “Bingo!”</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px"> “He was always so excited to take care of you.” As if time just ran past me, I’m already done with my sandwich.</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">. . .</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px">I hit my head on my neat white desk, wondering why homework is always so frustrating. I toss the papers back into my backpack, figuring I’ll just work on them tomorrow. I know exactly what’s going to happen today. We do this every year on the same day, and today just happens to be that day. Some things never leave you, and I remember this too well. </p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px"> “Felix was a close friend of your father, and such a good person. He was really fond of you, Tara.” She stifles her sobs.</p>
	 <p style="font-size:10px"> “I know.”</p>
         <p style="font-size:10px"> “He was always so excited to take care of you.”</p>
         <p style="font-size:10px">I know.</p>
         <p style="font-size:10px">“He said he thought of you as his own niece.”</p>
         <p style="font-size:10px">I know…</p>
<p style="font-size:10px">I retreat to my bed and huddle in my plush purple blanket as the sunlight glares through my open flower curtains. I feel disgusting. Why can’t my parents see? He’s still here, he’s still here. He was a great man, I know that. He’s not dead though, everyone just thinks he is. I see him. I hear him. I feel him-- and I feel bad for hating that. My skin shudders, and I try to make it stop-- it never works. I try to control my heavy breathing and the tears that threaten me as they sting my eyes. Here he is, again. We’re in the living room watching a movie. My curly dark brown pigtails sway as I’m falling asleep. “Shh,” he whispers. “Go to sleep, it’s okay.”
“Mom doesn’t like me sleeping during the day. She says it makes it harder to sleep at night.”
“It’s okay, your parents aren't here now.”
No one’s here…</p>
<p style="font-size:10px">The tears drop onto my brown hands. The door suddenly creaks open. “Honey, can you do the dish-” My heart sinks. It’s too late to take back the tears, She already noticed and immediately goes to comfort me. “Honey, no, it’s ok, it’s okay.”</p>
<p style="font-size:10px">“I’m a horrible person,” I cry. “What? No, no, baby, you’re not. It’s not your fault.” I pull away from her, disgusted with myself. “No, no. You don’t get it. I- I can’t help but hate him.” She’s confused. “Honey, I- I don’t understand.”
</p>
<p style="font-size:10px">“Everyone says he’s a good person and I just--” I sob in her arms. I tell her everything.
