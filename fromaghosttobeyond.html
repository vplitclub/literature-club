         <p style="font-size:14px">"No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried." One dark and stormy night, I was on my way home. I didn't have much energy as I was a first year student at college.
It had been a busy day with classes and I still had an essay due in two days.
Walking home, I decided to take the shortcut through the cemetery. As I was rushing through the cemetery, I thought I saw something moving. I continued walking and that’s when I almost   fainted. 
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">It was Uncle Felix! My heart was beating fast, and I kept wondering 'why isn’t he buried?' 
I just kept walking as fast as I could, even though I was scared to death! I kept telling myself that I’d call emergency services when I got home and everything would be alright, but Uncle Felix was getting closer and I could make out a creepy grin on his face, as if saying that I could take his place while he enjoys life.  
I screamed so loud and ran to the plaza across the street where all the lights were on and told someone what I witnessed. 
Later, I got on the Greenview Transit and made my way to the subway station. As I got to the station and into the train, Uncle Felix was hovering outside the window and I was so creeped out that I took a seat near a family with two children and their parents. 
As soon as I got off, I began walking quickly in well lit areas and rushed into the house. I told my family everything and the emergency services were 2 minutes away. As soon as they got here, Uncle Felix came out again, but this time holding a knife. 
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">I just don't understand something which is why Uncle Felix never could stay buried until the next morning when I met a lady telling fortunes. She began telling me that when my uncle was a kid, he made a magic potion, which is the reason he can never stay buried. 
I did a lot of research this morning and came up with a plan! I realized that all ghosts do not like “Orange Crush with avocados,” so I made some and left it aside to make it look like cookies. Hopefully, this will turn him back to normal and he can rest peacefully. 
As usual, Uncle Felix came again and drank the avocados with orange crush and it worked. He started fading away and on his last whiff, he mouthed the words “Thank You,”. I waved at him with a tear in my eye. 
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Ever since that day at the cemetery, I never took any shortcuts again when I was alone; especially at night! I stayed on the main road and walked where there were people and lights to be safe.</p>
