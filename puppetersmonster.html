         <p style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. My grandfather said it happened every fifteen years – “No more, and no less”, in his words – bringing forth sorrow: the likes of which was never seen at any other time. The years that followed the Taking were met with a period of mourning and sorrow which bled into my childhood – every day, the entire town would start the morning with a moment of silence for the Taken ones. Everyone participated; – there was not a single person in the entire town who had not had someone taken from them by Uncle Felix. 
	After the moment of silence, the mayor would deliver a short speech, followed by one from the Chief Advisor, my grandfather. The speeches were short, and different every morning, but they were always centered around the fact that we would never forget the Taken ones, and that the townspeople must be prepared for Uncle Felix’s next visit. At this, everyone’s mood darkened, with an air of fear hanging in the atmosphere. S, and, since I had never experienced a Reawakening, it always left me wondering, “How grave are Uncle Felix’s actions, that they have even the bravest cowering in fear? How has he managed to do something so drastic as striking fear into everyone’s hearts just by his name?” 
As I got older, I pondered it more and more. I could not understand how one person could have such an effect on an entire town. However, no one else seemed to share the same questions, and even if they did, they did not show it, since they set to work to the best of their ability, hoping to make the Taken proud. I did, too – at least, up until my first Reawakening.
	It was a strange day, as though the weather could not decide on its mood or its clothing: the sky was neither sunny nor ominous, or clear or cloudy. That day, I had been at the field, in the midst of a soccer match with a few of my friends, when the messenger ran up to us. He shouted, “Uncle Felix is back! He was last seen near the seamstresses’ buildings! Quick! Get to safety!” before hurrying off to warn others of this fact. 
	My friends and I looked at one another, panicked and confused. “But Uncle Felix isn’t supposed to be here for another six months, right?” asked one of the younger children in the group. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">“Well, either way, he’s here now, and there’s nothing we can do about it but hide!” exclaimed another, before running off. The rest of the group followed, dispersing in a frantic rush. I did the same, heading towards my home.
	As I ran, I went over the plan to escape Uncle Felix. It  was ingrained deeply in my mind – as I had been born only a year before the last Reawakening, I had grown up in its aftermath. As such, my grandfather had repeatedly drilled me on the protocols I would need to follow in order to keep both of us safe: enter the house through the back door, lock and bolt all the doors and windows, go to the basement, lock the door, open the hidden passageway on the floor of the basement, and head down to the hidden room underneath the house. Once I reached the house, I followed these instructions exactly, and did not stop until I had made it into the hidden basement, too overcome with fear to think of anything other than, I have to survive. 
  I did not even look for my grandfather – we had a rule that if my grandfather did not make it into the house within ten minutes of me hearing the announcement of Uncle Felix’s return, I was to assume he had already been Taken. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> In the hidden basement, I finally caught my breath, hoping that my grandfather had made it into the room before I did. It was dark, and yet, it took me a moment to notice it: located in the bottom right corner of the room, facing away from the ladder – and myself – was a desk with a monitor on it. My grandfather sat in front of the monitor, staring intently at the screen. As I stared at it with him, I realized that it was showing video footage of the town, with a glowing red counter slowly increasing on the side of the screen. 
	My grandfather suddenly noticed me, and spoke: “Now that you are witnessing your first Reawakening, Jason, would you like to help instruct Uncle Felix?”
	It all made sense to me, a sickening truth that latched on and would not let go: Uncle Felix was simply a puppet, and the real monster was the one controlling him. My grandfather. </p>
