         <p style="font-size:13px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. I saw him again today, in the same place as always. Outside the window, near the lobby of our apartment building, waving to us, right before going home and never waking up. Or at least, that’s what it seemed to be. He’s still here, even though no one believes it.</p>
         <p style="font-size:13px">Felix was my dad’s friend., Hhe would come to our house often when I was still a kid. He was practically family to us, and would babysit me when my parents weren’t home.
   
   </p>
         <p style="font-size:13px">Before he saw them, he heard them. Plates of metal clanking as two legions
of soldiers charged while screaming their battlecry, and Felix stood in the centre of
the action. Holding his sword by the hilt, still sheathed, Felix ducked under the
soldier's blade. Before the man could regain his guard, Felix pulled his blade from his
sheath in a powerful bursting motion which pummelled the soldier square in the face.
He flew back from the powerful blow, and before he could recover, Felix buried his
blade in his neck.</p>

<p style="font-size:13px">***</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">The fighting did not stop for hours, not until those who lived had scattered or laid
lifeless on the battlefield. Felix alone stood surrounded by a mountain of corpses.
He looked within himself, for any emotion of disgust, bloodlust, sorrow, hate,
or even pleasure, yet he only felt a wariness. A wariness that yearned for rest, an
eternal sleep.</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">***</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">The sun was already setting when Felix walked through the tense, but lively
streets of a small reinforcement town behind the front lines. The red clouds of dusk
flooded the sky like blood spewed from a fatal wound. Candle lights appeared
gradually, mirroring the flicker of stars in the heavens. The atmosphere bore a sense
of dread and despair.
“The enemy are pushing closer to this settlement day by day,” noted Felix, “it
will be conquered in a matter of days.”
Many shops were selling their last items before they evacuated. The citizens
were on high alert, carrying as many necessities as possible and heading away from
the front lines.</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">As Felix stumbled near the outskirts of the town he noticed a line of soldiers
forming a blockade at the town’s entrance.
‘They must be desperate to draft civilians... and children.’ A small flicker of
horror and rage awoke within his numb soul.
‘That was the age of my nephew when I saw him last—before he was drafted.’
As if the gods heard his thought, a young man in gleaming armour
approached Felix.
“Un-uncle Felix, is that you?” cried the young man. Uncle Felix felt an eternity
had passed since he saw his nephew. Like waking from a nightmare, all emotions he
could not feel before crashed against his soul like a great wave. His demeanour
faltered and his mental walls cracked. His face, though motionless, bled streams of
tears, cleansing his bloody and dirty face. His nephew approached him slowly and
embraced him despite Felix’s ragged clothes.
</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">“I—we thought you were dead! You went missing in action years ago!” his
nephew sobbed.
</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">“I’m sorry... I lost hope... I’m sorry...” Felix mumbled with tears, “I killed so
many... innocent soldiers”.
</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">“I am here for you uncle.”
</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">“Thank you for allowing me to feel again.”
</p>
<p style="font-size:13px">Felix held the embrace, shocked by the warmth of his body, the coolness of
the air. He felt the blood that stained his hands, the guilt of every life he took. He felt
it all. And the fatigue of life and yearning for death, he wished to never feel again.
