		 <p style="font-size:15px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he never seemed to stay buried.
We got used to the sight of his head protruding from the ground as his body clambered up
from beneath after it. It was a good thing; our hearts never stopped when we saw Felix’s lifeless
body anywhere because we knew he’d be sitting in his litter box the next morning.
That is our ritual.
He dies; we bury him within twenty-four hours and once he touches the soil he resets and
comes up again.
Felix has died seven times by my count. He’s been a careful cat but somehow accidents seek
him out. Still, he’s lived longer than most. So few cats are lucky to have nine lives like our Felix.
Or humans for that matter. His namesake, my actual uncle, died at the age of seventeen.
It’s been a long time since he’s joined the family and the arrangement has gone on pretty well.
I’m glad that I may never have to see this old pal of mine die before I do, as troubling as it may
be for him.</p>
         <p style="font-size:15px">I get up from bed and pour a good quantity of water in his bowl and set it down next to his
basket. He’s had that thing for about eighteen years now. It’s worn and getting dustier, I told my
sister Kate to buy him a new one but she’s always so forgetful. I sigh and put up a reminder on
the dining room wall to buy a basket for Felix.
He gulps down his water faster than I can for mine.
"So what are you going to get up to today, Felix?"
He jumps up and down twice and goes around my feet in a circle. He wants to walk.
I get his leash from the closet and put his little vest on, it’s a cold autumn day and although he
has fur he looks so much more adorable in his little green jacket.
I put my own jacket on and together we get out of the house and walk down the street towards
the park in our neighbourhood. The walk is like any other autumn walk, the trees sway in the
wind; there are no birds in sight; every once in a while we can hear the swooshing sound of a
car driving past us. Although Felix loves it when the birds come out to play, he also enjoys the
downcast skies and so do I, as the sun casts a mean ray on both our heads and by the time I put
a hand to our brows, we feel half-cooked.
After a few minutes I see the little path veering in towards the park, Felix and I head down the
sloped path, down the hill until we see our favourite bench standing out just a few meters away.
We sit down, Felix and I, and my lap welcomes the familiar weight of Felix and the slight
scratching of his claws. It’s another peaceful day.
There are other people with their cats too, this has become a bit of a cat park now since no
self-respecting (and pet-respecting) cat owner wants to go to the dog park 10 minutes away in
the other direction. Except today, there is a dog.</p>
         <p style="font-size:15px">All of us look up nervously - the faces of those about to enter a war. The dog is big and
mean-looking, bulky too. As we were expecting he starts barking right away and the cats hiss
and back away. The owner of the dog looks apologetic - clearly he’s a newcomer - and he turns
to go the other way, pulling his dog along with him. But the dog doesn’t budge. </p>
         <p style="font-size:15px">The owner pulls the lease again but this time the dog pulls with force until the leash snaps out
of the owner’s hand and the park turns into a bedlam. The dog goes crazy, the cats run one after
another, some of them injured or killed, and us owners all stand in bewilderment and horror. I
freeze when the dog turns on my Felix and bites into his neck.
Immediately, black spots threaten to cloud my vision, Felix has died before but never in such a
brutal way.</p>
         <p style="font-size:15px">When the dog finally stops to take a rest, I go over and pick up Felix by his shabby orange coat
and carry him home as he bleeds into my arm, I hear someone yelling in the distance.
I bury him in my garden and that night I go to sleep with half a heart, I barely get through the
night.
When I wake up, I see an orange cat in the basket. But... it’s not Felix.
The doorbell rings and I stand in shock as a man accuses me of stealing his cat.</p>
