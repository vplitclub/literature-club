            <h1 style=font-size:12px;>Loop of August</h1>
		 <i> by Mira Karout  </i>
         <p style="font-size:12px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. There I was, once again. August 26, 1987, was the day it all began. I was counting money to save up for some supplies once school started up again when I heard a loud banging against our door. At first, I didn’t think much of it because here in Texas, people walk in and out of homes acting as if they own the place, which is why I prefer staying in my room, watching West Side Story on my video cassette.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Jack, get the door!” I yelled for my brother, but the knocking didn’t stop so I raced upstairs and swung the door wide open. To my surprise, our local police officer, Sam, was standing there. He didn’t bother with me and immediately asked for my dad, saying it was urgent. </p>
         <p style="font-size:12px"> Dad and Sam talked, with painful looks on their faces. Once Sam left, Ddad plopped onto the cheap old couch and started to cry before mustering up the words to tell Mom, Jack, and me what happened. Uncle Felix, Dad's brother, had died. The cause: murder.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">Why? I kept asking myself. Why him? Uncle wasn't the type to get mixed up in gang violence. It didn’t make sense. He was the type of man to drop everything and come running if you were feeling sad, just to cheer you up. The type of man who’d always spread his wealth to the sick and poor, constantly working alongside non-profit funds to positively change the world. He always encouraged me to follow my dreams of becoming a professional painter and not helping my dad with his small business. My dad told me that we were already tight on money, so I should choose a less risky path for my future. But Uncle Felix always stood by my side, and he even told me he'd help with tuition. So why? The thought kept me up all night.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">I awoke to the sound of a sparrow outside my window. After getting the motivation to finally get out of bed, I noticed a strange envelope on my nightstand. Curious- I opened it up, and instead of a letter, there was a sheet of paper with a drawing on it, a dove. The design seemed so familiar, as if I'd seen it before. I flipped the paper over to its back and noticed a few words written on it. "Dove. Tree. North. 30 steps. Felix." My heart dropped. Who could have left that there? Is this about Uuncle? I decided to figure it out after breakfast. </p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">Turns out, neither my mom nor my brother seemed to know what it meant, and I couldn't ask Dad since he was at work. Everyone insisted that it was just some prank, but I had this horrible feeling that it was something more. I stared at the paper once again, Symbol…white dove…dove. Then it hit me, I have seen that symbol before, Dove!</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">They recently started selling the brand at a new store that opened up near my house. I decided to go check it out in the store parking lot. The next word in the letter was 'tree'. Beside a garbage can, there was a huge oak tree. North. 30 steps. I looked in the direction of the sun. If the sun rises in the east, and that's west…then that must be North! I continued to the next thing on the note:, 30 steps. I tried to make my paces wide enough to fit Uncle Felix's. 28…29…30! I stood in front of an old shed surrounded by trees</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">Taking a deep breath, I headed inside. It was a dark, cramped space. Everything inside was rusty, coated with dust, and broken. There laid a broken table in the corner that was cracked down the middle. I looked around, unsure whether I was supposed to find another envelope or something else. I soon discovered something strange behind the broken table. There were removable floor planks, and under them was a ladder. I was scared to go in at first, but what if Uncle Felix really was there? I needed to help him. I mustered up the courage and climbed down the ladder. As I reached the bottom, chills ran down my spine as I discovered a small room and a familiar voice.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Se..rra…"</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">Tears stung my eyes as I ran over to the tired man strapped in the chair.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Uncle? Uncle Felix, are-- are you okay? I'll get you out, I promise--"</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"R…"</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Yeah?"</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Un.."</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"What..?"</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"R..un"</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">Another familiar voice suddenly appeared.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">"Serra."</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">I froze in my place.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">"It seems you've discovered my letter."</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">"Dad..?"</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">.</p>
         <p style="font-size:12px">.</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px">I counted my money, setting some aside for school. August 26, 1987. There I was, again.</p>
