         <p style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. The old bastard
had been through hell and highwater despite his senile apperance. Everytime my mom - fighting
through tears - calls and informs me that the man had died for sure this time, it always turns out
to be a false alarm, and you know what? Somehow, with each, otherworldly, ridiculous
explanation of his death, the next one always, in some horrifyingly comical way, tops the last.
Now, I know I’ve got you interested, but, stating every time Uncle Felix died would take at least
a month of concurrent explanation without pause or break. And, because in doing so I would
exceed my 800 word limit, I’ll leave it to your imagination. What’s that? You don’t know what I
mean when I say 800 word limit?</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Don’t worry about it.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">To give you a quick idea of how outlandish these stories are, last Sunday I was sipping my
morning coffee when mom phoned in sobbing yet again. Apparently, old Felix decided it’d be a
good idea for him to take dim-wittedness to the max and fully utilize his rock brain.
The date? October 30th 2022. On this fateful morning stupidity incarnate woke up, brushed his
teeth and ate breakfast all the while having two rational thoughts in his head. The first being,
“Ooga booga”, and the second being, “lol, wouldn’t it be fun if Halloween snowed?”. Taking his
idea further, he decided that it would be an amazing idea to steal his neighbors woodchipper,
wheel it in front of the town hall and shred enough paper to account for every tree in the Amazon in order to recreate the feeling of snow and have a White</p> <s> Christmas</s> <p style="font-size:14px">Halloween.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Old Felix soon found himself standing in front of the large, cathedral-like town hall on Victoria
Park and Ellesmere, armed and ready to cover the streets with nothing but little, white paper
shreds. Except there was one problem. He had no paper.
I hope you can tell by now, but my Uncle Felix isn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the box, or the
garage, or the yard, or the block, or the city. He is what we call, a genetic anomaly. However, as
dull as he is, Uncle Felix knew very well where everything was. Brookbanks Library was just a
minute's walk from the scary, brick laced private school, and his old high school, Victoria Park,
was no more than a few blocks away. Thus, Uncle Felix had an idea.
He bolted as fast as his stubby little legs could take him and headed straight for Brookbanks
Library, dragging his woodchipper behind him, trying not to fall.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Upon arrival, he swung open the door, hauled the wood chipper in, and decided that today would
be the day where he’d laugh off a multitude of felonies. Chucking in any, and every thing he
could see, within seconds, half of the library was completely emptied out and filled back up with

the remains of what used to be hundreds and thousands of books. Kids were kicking and
screaming, the staff froze up in shock, one little girl might have possibly flown in by accident, it
was as if Fahrenheit 451 had been revamped with a bunch of clumsy, wood chipper wielding
idiots.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">And then it was over.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">He had just defiled the library and had made no progress towards his “White Halloween”, yet he
was surprisingly pleased with himself as if he had just done the world some good. Grimacing, he
exited the library and stared down the gray concrete road leading towards VPCI.
Walking into the school, he was soon greeted by the large sign in front of the door adjacent to
him which displayed, “ENGLISH DEPARTMENT. KEEP OUT, WILL BITE.”
Unfortunately, my uncle Felix can’t read.
Lugging the heavy wood chipper into the room, he found a treasure trove of overdue homework
assignments, soon to be given exams, course texts, and anything you could imagine an English
teacher might have. He thought to himself, “Hmm, shredding all of this would prevent weeks of
homework given to all those poor kids! They’d finally have some time to themselves!” So, he
turned on the wood chipper, sharpened his pencil with it, wrote on the wall, “fewx was hier”,
drew a piece of poop beside it and left. Because who cares about students anyways.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Finally, with two counts of trespassing, 14352 counts of destruction of private property and one
count of murder, old Uncle Felix walked back home, happy, that he had created a white
halloween in at least one place.
Then he got hit by a semi-truck.
Fortunately for him, he had somehow been resuscitated by the grace of God and ended up
surviving.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">It snowed the next day.
