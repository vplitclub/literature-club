         <p style="font-size:14px"> No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried.
I watched from the window as he limped up our driveway, snowflakes swirling around his thin form. He stepped up to our door and knocked, just once. My dad used to say that a single knock could wake up the dead. I tried once, after he died. It didn’t work. 
My mom rushed to the doorway, pausing for a second before letting my uncle in. 
“Felix.” Mom drew him into a tight embrace.
He went limp, his dazed eyes as pale as the icicles crusting his beard.
Felix brushed past us, slouching onto the sofa. Mom gave him a look, so he sighed and asked me, “How have you been, Arden?”
He’s actually talking to me?
“Uh, fine, I guess.” I said, “How have… you been?” 
“Oh, I’ve been doing great,” he said with a sarcastic smile., “Death is quite an enjoyable endeavour.”
I wished I could shove my words back down my throat.
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">...</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">I couldn’t sleep. One thought plagued my consciousness.
Why does Uncle Felix keep coming back?
Suddenly another thought struck me. There was a family album downstairs. Maybe I would get some answers there. 
Slipping out of bed, I snuck into the living room. I slid my hand along the shelves until I grasped a hard plastic spine. I pulled it out and started flipping through the pages.
One photo caught my eye. It was my parents on their wedding day, beaming at the camera. I stared at my dad. He had brown hair and hazel eyes, just like me. He seemed so young; I wondered how he died. I had never really asked, because Mom always avoided the subject. 
The next picture was of my mom and an old man who looked a lot like my father. Who was my father, I realized.
This didn’t make sense. 
Both pictures were of my dad.
Both pictures were of my mother, but she hadn’t aged at all between them.
The final picture broke me. 
My parents were holding the hand of a small child. His ice-blue eyes were unmistakable.
Felix. Now I could see the resemblance between my dad and him. He had to be… my brother.
This can’t be real, I told myself as I went back up the stairs and into my bed. The album was still in my arms as I drifted away.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">...</p> 
         <p style="font-size:14px">Early the next morning, I confronted my mother over breakfast. 
	“When were you going to tell me Felix was my brother?” I said. She went as pale as the milk in her cereal bowl. “There are some… things you don’t know. You’re not ready yet.”
	“Like the fact that my father aged significantly and somehow you didn’t?” I shoved my spoon into my bowl, sending Cheerios flying. “Oh, I think I’m ready. So go ahead. How many secrets do you have?”
 	“A lot,” she said, looking down. “There’s a… family curse. My curse is immortality, which is why I don’t age.”
I shoved back my chair and stood up. One word shot through my bones.
Run.
Felix came into the kitchen, bleary-eyed. “What’s going on--”
I slammed the door. Tears streamed down my face, blurring my vision as I ran across the road. I was so upset I didn’t notice the bus speeding toward me.
“Arden!” Felix shouted, tackling me to the ground.
But it was too late.</p> 
   <p style="font-size:14px">I am sitting in a field of flowers. This place seems… oddly familiar. Stars blink in and out above me. The air smells sweet, like pollen and decay. A man sits down beside me.</p>
   <i>It’s beautiful, isn’t it?</i>
   <p style="font-size:14px">Felix says, but his mouth does not move.</p>
   <p style="font-size:14px">Yeah, it really is, I reply.</p>
   <p style="font-size:14px">He turns to me, eyes serious. </p>
   <i>Listen, I’m sorry--</i>
   <i>No, it’s okay. I’m dead now anyway.</i>
   <i>That’s not the point. There’s still something you don’t know.</i>
   <p style="font-size:14px">He takes my hand, and we float up into the abyss. An old-looking TV appears in front of us. Felix turns it on. Felix and my parents watch in silence as a tiny coffin is lowered into a hole. The inscription on it reads, Arden Drewitt. Gone too soon.</p>
   <p style="font-size:14px">My ears are pounding. I-I don’t understand, I say.</p>
   <p style="font-size:14px">You will, I promise, Felix responds, skipping ahead.
My own grave is on the screen. As I watch, the dirt in front of it starts to cave in, pale little hands digging out of the hole. My past self steps out of the grave, dusts off her dress, and skips all the way home.</p>
   <p style="font-size:14px">I understand now. I understand everything, and nothing at the same time.
It’s time to go back home, my brother says. I let him lead the way, my thoughts as scattered as the stars around us.</p>
