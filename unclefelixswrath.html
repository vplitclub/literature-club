		 <i style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. And trust me,
many tried to end him, but only one was able to...</i>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Uncle Felix was a kind and loving man, a father figure, a wise mentor, and a loving
friend to all who knew him. His life was very reptivitive, consisting of the same old cycle for
over three decades. The strange manner in which he succumbed to his death may be the only
interesting aspect of his existence.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">One dull afternoon, Uncle Felix was bit by a rather peculiar insect. The side effects of its
bite were ... weird, to say the least. Uncle Felix expected the wound to hurt for some time, then
to go away; but it didn’t. Instead, the bite resulted in the 54-year-old mysteriously dropping dead.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> The villagers mourned the tragic death of their one and only Uncle Felix. After a gruly
autopsy conducted by the best doctors in the town, the cause of Uncle Felix’s death could not be
identified.
The villagers held a gorgeous ceremony to commemorate Uncle Felix, but to their
surprise, this would not be the last time they would see him. No one could anticipate Uncle
Felix’s ability of magically opening his coffin and freeing himself from his grave.
Two weeks following Uncle Felix’s burial, multiple sightings of the man had been
reported, however no one could tell if it was indeed Uncle Felix. The sweet and kind man
everyone knew had changed. He had become a real beast. His round pupils had turned blood red,
his veins would occasionally start bulging, and he would constantly shake uncontrollably. He
brought terror to the small community. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">Each and every villager attempted to shoot the mysterious creature resembling Felix.
After every killing, a new funeral would be held for Felix. Little did they know that the monster
would return to haunt them again.
The town held numerous gatherings to discuss the situation. Everyone felt anxious; no
one felt safe in their own home.
These sightings continued time and time again. Until one day, everyone’s greatest fears
were realized ...</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">“Archie is missing!” a villager yelled at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">The officers at the police station jumped from their seats and ran to console the distressed
mother.
“What happened?” the sheriff asked the worried woman.
“My Archie! He’s missing!” she cried. “I opened his bedroom door this morning to wake
him up, but he wasn’t there. Something has happened to him, someone has taken him!” she
wailed.
“Don’t worry,” the sheriff reassured, “We will do our best to find your son.”
At first, the local police station did not look into this case much. But, soon, many more
similar cases were reported to the police over the next few weeks. Terrified mothers and fathers
would barge into the station; frightened for their child’s safety.
The police decided to keep a close eye on the villagers and keep a lookout for any strange
activity. They continued to do so for months and soon started to notice a pattern in the
disappearances. The police began surveilling the areas where they suspected the next kidnapping
would occur. To their astonishment, their plan eventually led them to the figure responsible for
the chaos.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">Their efforts led them to something similar to Felix. The group was stunned. But this was
not the Felix they knew and loved. He had gotten larger, scarier, and looked like a wild beast ...
The officers also noticed the children that were snatched; now lifeless. They all laid in the dark
corner of the room, deceased. Felix had done the unthinkable to the poor children. He had taken
their lives and ruined the lives of many who were still living.
The sheriff decided to deal with Felix once and for all; alone. He ordered all his men to
leave the room at once. Then, the sheriff proceeded to douse the room with kerosene. The sheriff
took out his good, old, trusty lighter without hesitation and sent the room ablaze.
Felix was burned to crisps in a matter of seconds. Although innocent lives were lost
forever, this heroic act by the late, valiant sheriff relieved the townspeople, knowing that Felix
could no longer harm anyone. They continued to live their lives peacefully, far from any danger,
or so they thought ...</p>
