         <p style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried.
In the middle of the night I rushed to the hospital after I heard the bad news, our uncle Felix had died. It was due to a heart attack, it wasn’t a surprise since our family history, yet he had a heart of gold and we will all miss him, especially my dad. My dad and uncle Felix only had each other growing up since they were orphans.
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">When I arrived there it was too late, uncle Felix was gone and dad was a crying mess. Mom was trying to comfort him but it was no use, he was sitting on a chair in the now-empty room with his hands covering his face.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">My mom noticed me and gave me a hug, she told me something, barely above a whisper, and then I left, she wanted me to bury him.
My dad’s parents died when he was 14 and his brother was 17. He couldn’t bear to let go of them, so it was his brother who took care of the bodies. My dad said that even though they were dead, he could still see them, until one day they stopped coming back, it was after uncle Felix made steak for dinner. Uncle Felix told him their parents were offended because they were vegan and went to enjoy the afterlife and they can’t wait for us to join them, I guess he joined them now.
</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">I found the body and a shovel that my mom placed behind the dumpsters of the building and found a good spot on a grassy field. Years ago, uncle Felix took initiative and moved to a house near this hospital because our family has a history of getting very sick and dying at young-ish ages. He thought if one was nearby then it would prolong their lives but it never worked.
I got to digging the hole that was just barely 5ft and dumped the body there and covered it just like that, no coffin or even a proper funeral.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">The next day passed on and dad was happy again, making breakfast and humming along to a familiar tune. This was quite strange because my parents were never morning people. I was the first to wake up, my eyes adjusting to the light of the kitchen. “You’re happy this morning?” I say as I grab a glass and fill it with water. “Why wouldn’t I be? My brother is over to visit” he said all smiley, “What are you talking about?” And that’s when I saw Uncle Felix’s dead body propped up on a chair at the dining table, my eyes widened and I dropped my glass, stumbling back in fear. How did he end up there? Mom rushed in because the noise of the glass shattering alarmed her, she wasn't prepared for the sight either. My dad made us act nice to Uncle Felix’s corpse as we uncomfortably sat around him at the dinner table. “Felix, how was your day today?” Dad started a conversation with him and to no one’s surprise, he didn’t answer.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">At night I was watching the news when I was startled by my mom with a shovel in hand. I knew what to do and headed out in my pajamas on this cold windy night and dug a hole. This time exactly 6ft and dumped his body there, this time there was no way he would come back.
In the morning it was mom’s turn to find him, only this time he was on the couch next to my dad with a beer in his hand. Mom screamed, alerted me and we stood there in shock. How on earth was it possible that he was back, dad couldn’t have been digging him back up, he was at home very often, writing a lot and whispering things, always being sad.
This continued for a few days, he was everywhere and we couldn’t get rid of him. Until one day… "Mom, Dad, dinner time!" I made dinner for our family. A nice steak cooked medium rare, it was delicious, very tender, and juicy. Even though I rarely cooked my dad always said my cooking reminded him of his brothers. This steak especially reminded him of his brothers from when they were young.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px">After dinner, I washed the dishes and went to bed exhausted. When I woke up dad was crying, muttering something about Felix not being around anymore. It was sad to hear him upset but at least I could cheer him up with my cooking. I was thinking of making steak again. My supply will probably last for a while, so I should finish before it rots.
