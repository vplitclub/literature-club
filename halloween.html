		 <p>NOTE: this is not accurate to reincarnation. 

No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. This wasn’t a common problem in the tombs, most dead ones stayed put in their graves. Most of them, having accpeted fate, usually slept it and waited for their reincarnation, save for Uncle Felix, an enigma. 

In the creaky forest, Eva walked across to Uncle Felix’s tomb, the grass wrinkling and creasing under their feet. Leaning down, they knocked at the top of the cracked stone, waiting for an answer. Not quite the nicest fellow. 

They knocked 12 more times, and the ground groaned, and opened like a coffin. It made way for a monster, of blood, spit and a concotion of oil spitting out. It flopped around, before slowly forming fingers. Mitosis, and Eva watched as the bones jutted out, oil forming around them, leaky and stainable. 

“Hello.” It grinned with all its funky rock teeth. 

“Hello Uncle,” Eva responded with a grin. “I’m here to send you to your final destination.”

He paled, as the charcoal goop seemed to flake off.  “Don’t worry, I’m really bad at my job.” 

A laugh, chimed like wind. “Can’t believe they want me to stay dead.” The fingers arose back and forth like waves, before settling down into the hole of the tomb. 

“You’ve been alive too many times. You must settle down for your final life, before returning to where you belong.” Eva proclaimed. 


“Where I belong…. Haha. I think I wil turn that offer down.” And he fell down with a hunkering smile, before Eva could catch any remains of him.  They let out a frustrated sigh. They would simply have to wait and watch, before they could catch him into their Jar. One day. 

Such a slow process. 

Unfortunately, Eva never managed to catch him. He just never came out of that hole.
