         <p style="font-size:14px"> No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. He
only arose from his grass-covered tomb to pay me a visit. The maggots in his eyes and
his dirt-fresh rotting corpse would draw worms into the shared attic every time he
returned to his former room, which was now mine. He'd return to only gaze at me before
disappearing as a corpse on the front step without saying anything. My relatives would
laugh, stating that such an untalented child had no place in the family and that the
reappearance of his corpse was most likely a hoax. My uncles loved kicking his corpse
back into the ravine where he was buried, not realizing how his eyes would connect with
mine. He'd then smile a little smile, but the notion was so foreign to his body that his
cheek would gape and his skull would hang on tendons coated with brain tissue. He
would appear day after day, lacking more bones and flesh, until he began using me as
his body. Uncle Felix's body seemed like mush as I tried to fight him, and as my hands
slid into his stomach, I could sense his misery. His head was filled with terror, and I
couldn't keep up with all the feelings, to the point where Felix had taken possession of
not just my body but also my thoughts. Every time he returned, I could feel pieces of my
body withering and rotting. I couldn't tell where I was anymore. I'd be bloodied, my hands
covered with my own flesh, bones hanging loose from my fingers, pleading for aid, but
no one rushed to help or batted their eyes when blood gushed out of mine. They
laughed at me as much as they did at him, and Felix's decaying corpse of nothing but
bones would soon exploit me to fulfill his greed before sleeping once more. When I
awoke, I was burying my own family in the ravine where Uncle Felix lay, and I understood
that Uncle was no longer in my head. There was only me.</p>
