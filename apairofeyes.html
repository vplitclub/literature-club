         <p style="font-size:14px">No matter how many times Uncle Felix died, he just never seemed to stay buried. I was eleven the first time we had Uncle Felix buried. The air was humid and sticky, smelling strongly of pine trees and dirt. Felix requested his body be buried in the forest, his Will stating clearly that he wished for his corpse to be “returned to nature, feasted upon by worms and centipedes, his eyes plucked out by the eagles.”I clung weakly onto my fathers hand as we stood above the crater in the ground, Felix’s corpse lying peacefully on a mound of dirt below. He looked alive; almost as if he was in another drunken stupor, able to be forcefully shaken awake and handed a glass of water. His eyes had been extracted hours earlier, but never fed to the eagles. As I stared into his empty, blood-crusted sockets,I was reminded about what they once held. The mortician performing the extraction said that “eyes were the gateway to the soul” before using a melon baller to excavate his gateways and plop them onto a metal dish.It appeared that behind his gateway’s, Uncle Felix's soul was empty and dark--the void. But I knew it wasn’t true.I knew the soul lay much deeper, that the soul coursed through our veins.It was in the blood--it was still in Uncle Felix. 
           The worms and centipedes could have his flesh, hell they could have his blood and his organs and feast on his necrotic liver; but I would be keeping the eyes. 
           They felt squishy in the pockets of my dress.I reached in and grabbed hold of one of the spongy bulbs which felt like peeled grapes, twirling his optic nerve about my finger.
           I giggled silently,reminded of how they would bulge out of his head while he was alive, how I’d always wanted to reach out and pluck one out myself. </p>
         <p style="font-size:14px"> As I progressed through childhood, I would see Uncle Felix buried frequently. I scraped a shallow grave on the forest floor, using my bare hands to scratch away at the nearly frozen dirt.It was getting caught underneath my fingernails. I cradled Felix’s body in between my palms, and placed him gently into the dirt grave. His feathers were ruffled from his struggle with me. His beak hung off to the side, and his neck was bent at a dangerous angle. I supposed I had broken it. It’s his fault really, he shouldn’t have come back again. He was always coming back. First he returned as a cat. I quite liked him in that form, he was playful and made me laugh just like he had before his first death. But it couldn’t last--the dead couldn’t stay alive, it was unnatural, and cruel to suggest that there was anything beyond life to hope for. Father says this makes us crave death; it confirms that life has no meaning. Each time I buried Felix, his form reappeared in my life. It didn’t matter if I drowned the cat, burned the snake, or strangled the birds. He would always come back.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">When I had reached adulthood, I fell pregnant and endured nine unimaginable months of torture. My abdomen was swelling as each week slipped by, and I could only imagine that I was fermenting the awful parasite that lay within me, the monster I was supposed to love. My husband was no help--constantly droning on about how I had to take this supplement, another vitamin, and visit this doctor and this specialist, all for the health of his child that he 
endowed on me. I could feel the walls of the midwife's birthing suite closing in around me. I had already allowed this child to starve me of my beauty and youth,ravage my body, claiming it as his own, and now I was supposed to spend every waking moment tending to his crying, burping, slurping, and whining.</p>
         <p style="font-size:14px">I embraced my sentence, not because I thought I deserved it or accepted my guilt. I wrapped my weak arms around it and kissed it gently across the forehead, as a mother would do to her stillborn infant,reborn Uncle. I looked into its soulless, dead, black eyes, but saw only my own reflection; realizing it all to be a sadistic, cruel joke. I was the mother to my own suffrage, my own pain, my own entrapment. I could not be saved or freed, there was no choice. I was to live with it until it decayed in my arms, leaving behind its small, brittle remains. A delicate femur, a bird-like skull, all mementos of the torture that I had brought upon myself. All for stealing a pair of eyes that were rightfully mine.</p>
